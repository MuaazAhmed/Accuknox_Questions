Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your
answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be
elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer 2: Yes, Django signals are executed in the same thread as the caller. This means that the signal handler shares the same thread as the code that triggered the signal.
